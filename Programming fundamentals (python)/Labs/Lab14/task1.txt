Create a BMP file in paintbrush of any width and height, and note the both on paper.

Open file in rb+ mode, seek and read width as 4 bytes of image stored in header of BMP, later do the same with height. Convert bytes to integer using int.from_bytes function and display the width and height of image on screen. Compare it with written on paper.

Now seek again the height of BMP and update it with half of the original height. Lastly close the file, and view the BMP in paintbrush again.
