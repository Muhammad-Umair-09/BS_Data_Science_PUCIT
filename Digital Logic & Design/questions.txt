1.Construct 16×1 using appropriate numbers of 4×1 with enable input active low
2.Design 4 bit binary adder that does A+B with appropriate number of binary adders
3. Design 8×1 using 3×8 decoder and external Circuitry
4.Design code converter
8 4 -2 -1 and input and 2's complement as output
5. A and B are 4 bit numbers 
Find A>=B when A= A³A²A¹A⁰ and B=B³B²B¹B⁰
6. Assume we have to design BCD to Excess-3 code converter using multiplexers with
inputs A,B, C, D and outputs W.X,Y,Z. Keep variables A, B and C as select lines to the
multiplexer. What size of MUX is required to implement the above function? Also
mention how many multiplexers are required?
7. Number of decoder required that take 3 bit as input and generate its square as output
8. Design a Circuit which multiplies 4 bit number with 2 bit number and use binary adders to make it
9.assume we have to implement full subtractor circuit using Multiplexer. Answer the
following
Size of MUX
Number of MUX
10. Counter using RS
11. Priority encoder
